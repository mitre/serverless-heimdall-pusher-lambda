## How Does This Lambda Work?

The lambda function is triggered when new files hit an S3 bucket that you specify under the `unprocessed/*` folder. The lambda will then take several steps to process the results:
1. Fetch the new file from S3
2. Form a valid API request for a [Heimdall server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2) and tag the result with `HeimdallPusher`
3. Send the API request to the configured Heimdall server
4. Save the HDF to the same S3 bucket under `hdf/*`
5. Save the original file to the same S3 bucket under `processed/*` 
6. Delete the unprocessed version of the file from the S3 bucket

## How Can I Deploy This Lambda with Terraform?

Before deploying with terraform you will need to pull the docker image to your deployment machine
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/mitre/serverless-heimdall-pusher-lambda:<version>
```

```hdf
##
# Heimdall Pusher Lambda function
#
# https://github.com/mitre/serverless-heimdall-pusher-lambda
#
module "serverless-heimdall-pusher-lambda" {
  source = "github.com/mitre/serverless-heimdall-pusher-lambda"
  heimdall_url      = "https://target-heimdall.com"
  heimdall_user     = ""
  heimdall_password = ""
  results_bucket_id = "bucket_name"
  subnet_ids        = ["subnet-00000000000000000"]
  security_groups   = ["sg-00000000000000000"]
  lambda_role_arn   = aws_iam_role.InSpecRole.arn
  lambda_name       = "serverless-heimdall-pusher-lambda"
}
```

## What Format Do JSON Files Need to Be in for the Function to Process Results?

New files that are added to the S3 bucket under `unprocessed/*` and are in the below format can trigger the lambda and have it process the results properly.

```javascript
{
  "data": {}, // This is where the HDF results go
  "eval_tags": "ServerlessInspec,RHEL7" // These are any tags that should be assigned in Heimdall
}
```
